Module: Fundamental of Data Analysis


The following repository exists to illustrate the answers to the following queries: What is Pyplot?, What are categorical and continuous data?, and the CAO jupyter notebook gives a comparative study of CAO points for 2021 and 2020 and describes and analyses the statistical relationships, if any, between the two.

The repository contains:
2 Jupyter notebooks:
-------------------------
1.) pyplot-repeat: A notebook illustrating the pyplot submodule in matplotlib, a Python library module. This notebook also describes the differences between, and definitions of, continuous and categorical data.

2.) cao-repeat: A notebook containing an overview of data that I collected from the CAO website for required points for entry to college courses for years 2021 and 2020 respectively. I cleaned the data in Excel and fed it into a Pandas dataframe to provide comparative analysis for the two years.

Notebooks can be run through the Anaconda Navigator by navigating to the Jupyter Notebook functionality. Opens PC directory where downloaded file can be selected and displayed in web browser.
